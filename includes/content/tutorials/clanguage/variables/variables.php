	  <h1>Variables</h2>
      <p>The C programming language gives us a handful of different variable types that are useful for solving a multitude of different problems. We can use variables to store values that we wish to use later in our program, or we can manipulate the variables if we need to keep track of changes with our 3pi, or display values that we want to monitor. Since the C programming language doesn’t have a “boolean” value, we will only cover two different types of variables: numerical, and text.</p>
